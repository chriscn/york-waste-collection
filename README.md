# York Waste Collection
[York Council](https://www.york.gov.uk/HouseholdWaste) provide an online calendar to see the next time your waste should be collected. On the backend they use an API. This GitHub project aims to document a few of their APIs and how to use them.  
Details of which can be found in the [API](./docs/API.md) document.
Schema, endpoints and all project ideas have moved to [Project](./docs/PROJECT.md).
## Getting Started
Just head to [York Waste Calendar](https://example.org) to get started. This just contains all the source code behind the project; all the project is open source under the MIT license allowing anyone to make changes.
## Running the project
I am planning to run the project of a $5 a month DigitalOcean droplet. Going to finish writing the backend and then start the frontend.
